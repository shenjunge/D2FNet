# D2FNet：Dual-Domain Fusion Network for Bearing Fault Diagnosis
In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in bearing fault diagnosis, primarily driven by deep learning-based methodologies. However, effectively identifying bearing faults, particularly in their early stages and under challenging conditions such as very low signal-to-noise ratios, remains a very challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel dual-domain fusion network elaborately designed for fault diagnosis. Our innovative approach integrates both timedomain and time-frequency features to enhance the discriminative capabilities of fault diagnosis. To achieve this, we introduce attention mechanisms into both the time-domain and frequencydomain feature extraction networks, benefiting the network to learn highly discernible features crucial for fault diagnosis. Specifically, we incorporate the Inception-like Frequency Map
(IFMs) transformation to convert one-dimensional time-domain data into two-dimensional grayscale images efficiently. This transformation facilitates the extraction of fault-awareness features. To further boost separability in the time-frequency domain and improve diagnostic accuracy, we employ a contrastive learningbased Vision Transformer (ViT) algorithm for time-frequency feature extraction network. Through the integration of contrastive learning, self-attention mechanisms, and global feature extraction capabilities, this adaptation significantly improves the network’s proficiency in distinguishing similar categories within
the time-frequency domain. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging PU dataset demonstrate that our proposed method effectively learns discriminative time-domain and timefrequency features, leading to superior accuracy in bearing fault diagnosis compared to other state-of-the-art competitors.
